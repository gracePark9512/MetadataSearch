///
/// - important: When you implement these protocols you should not remove
/// anything from this file as our tests depend on this interface (and the
/// following assignment too!)
///
/// - note: You may add your own functions/properties etc. as needed -- we also
/// encourage you to develop your own protocols.

/// Represents a file with metadata (a key/value store)
///
/// In this protocol we define three properties and that it must confrom to the
/// CustomStringConvertable protocol (i.e. it also needs to have a description
/// property).

/// Protocol to represent metadata for a media file
///
/// In this protocol we define three properties and that it must confrm to the
/// CustomStringConvertable protocol (i.e. it also needs to have a description
/// property).
///
/// We're using a simple key/value pair as our metadata. For example:
///
///    IMG2018-06-18.png
///    photographer: Paul Crane
///    taken: 2018-06-18 10:14:54
///    location: Dunedin, New Zealand
///
/// When we search for the metadata, we ultimately want to display the files
/// that have that metadata, we're keeping track of the associated file here.
